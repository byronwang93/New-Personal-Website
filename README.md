# Personal-Portfolio-Website

Welcome to my personal website! Since September of 2021, I've been using this web platform as a method to apply my knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Through this project, I've definitely gained a stronger understanding and appreciation for web applications online.

Update(s) for the future:
- update the site to be responsive through the application of the flex model
- update the dark/light mode feature to retain the lighting after a user comes back to the site

I'll be updating this ReadMe after major updates to the site so stay tuned!
