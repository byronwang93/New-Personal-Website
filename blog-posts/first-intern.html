    <h2 class="blogTitle">Getting My First Work Experience As A Web Dev</h1>

    <h3 class="blogDate"> Date: Feb 1 2022 </h3>
    <h3 class="blogDate">Takeaway: Definitely not a how-to guide, but here are the steps I took to prepare and successfully obtain a position at PDFTron Systems as a web developer for this upcoming summer.</h3>

    <p>The first work experience. Notoriously known to be an extremely difficult process (and it is), the one thought that was racing through my mind when I got into the co-op program at UBC back at the beginning of the year was how unprepared I was to work in the industry. Call it Imposter Syndrome, or lack of self-confidence, but looking at my friends and classmates who've already gotten positions, I just didn't feel like I was on the same playing field as them.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Taking this into account, I was fully prepared for rejection but was willing to give it my best shot, so starting as early as September 26, 2021, I started applying for jobs for the summer of 2022.</p>

    <blockquote>"If you are 50% qualified ... apply!"</blockquote>

    <p>A quote taken directly from my job search workshop slides, I applied to (almost) every single company that I was remotely qualified for. Although I had a preference for web developer positions, I also applied for backend, fullstack, ASIC developer and bioinformatics positions, knowing that getting an interview definitely didn't mean anything unless I performed well in that as well.</p>

    <br>

    <p>At the time of applying, the only real notable experience I had was my experience working as a teaching assistant, the course material from my classes, and this website, so I knew it wasn't much to work with and by mid January, I had applied for a total of 64 different companies, ranging from small startups to companies in FAANG (MAANG?). Somehow, I ended up receiving interview offers from 4 different companies, so I stopped applying for jobs and shifted my focus towards prepping for the technical interviews.</p>
